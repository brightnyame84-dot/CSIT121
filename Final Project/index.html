        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>When working on this project i faced some challenges trying to fit the logo on the hero header.

            What i noticed when testing the site was that i feels like the website wants to lag but it doesnt.
            And also it was a nice experience taking this course and also learning about Web Standards.
