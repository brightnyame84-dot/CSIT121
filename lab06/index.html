            <h2>Recommendation</h2>
            <p>
                To improve user experience, Chelsea Fc could ensure that every icon and image include accurate <code> alt</code> text which could push accessibility closer to a perfect score.
                With what have learnt so far and according to the result i got from the accessibility checker. I think they can work on that.
