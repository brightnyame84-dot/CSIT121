                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>
                        1. I learnt that when creating a new html file, the process is a bit complicated because almost all the work is type manually by you.
                         
                    </p> 2. I also learnt that when you skip the slash sigh and enter h1 or h2, the following words below will all be highlighted until you correct it.
                    <p>
                        Learning visual code has been interesting so far and i'm hoping to know more and understand the concept even better as we move forward.
