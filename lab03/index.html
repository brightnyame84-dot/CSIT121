        My first time creating a new HTML file without using the formatted file html.5. The process is a bit
        confusing but with the instruction in the assignment, i was able to follow and it helped me complete this
        project.
        </p>
        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I learnt that when creating a new html file, the process is a bit complicated because almost all the
                work is type manually by you.</li>
            <li> I also learnt that when you skip the slash sigh and enter h1 or h2, the following words below will all
                be highlighted until you correct it.</li>
            <li>Learning visual code has been interesting so far and i'm hoping to know more and understand the concept
                even better as we move forward.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            With the help of the website below i was able to complete this project by following the instructions on
            the page.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">click here to access the page</a></li>

            Page is missing an ordered list. Instead you added numbers in your paragraph. This was the feedback i
            recieved from lab 2 and i later realised i actually didnt add that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the course materials and W3schools was really help because it breaks down reading materials into
            details and it makes it easy to understand.I'm really looking forward to understanding CSS and HTML better
            and be to work around it with ease.

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Internal CSS: Puts rules inside a style tag in the head of the page.</li>
            <li>External CSS; Link seperate stylesheet file.</li>
            <li>CSS Basics: Talks abour element selector, class selector, ID selector.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here are some resource that helped me this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">Single click to open</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/wRNinF7YQqQ?si=GjCUMonbr65fCJe_">CSS intro</a></li>
